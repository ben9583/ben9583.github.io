        <p> It has been my honor and privilege to represent the Town of Fountain Hills’ residents, businesses, and visitors as your council member.
        </p>
        <p>
        Over the last six years, I utilized my business and civic experience in municipal government and economic development to help create a better environment for all.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
I am so pleased and humbled to announce my candidacy for Mayor of the Town of Fountain Hills. As your Mayor, we will continue to work together to improve the quality of life for everyone!</p>
        <p>
My primary role as Mayor will <b>be as an advocate for the people of The Town of Fountain Hills.</b> There are many issues that will come before us in the next few years. They include completing our downtown, finalizing a sustainable revenue source, procuring a master developer for the state trust land and keeping our World Famous Fountain clean and in optimal operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Second, the mayor should be a <b>vital and active communications link</b> between the people and the Town. While wearing the various business, economic development, and civic “hats”, my role as Mayor will be to stay in touch with both citizens and businesses to keep everyone better informed and to receive their input for better decision making.
        </p>
        <p>
        Third, as Mayor, I will <b>be a valued partner with the town manager and staff</b> by taking advantage of my diverse business and public sector experience, skills, and perspectives. Together, we will accomplish the strategic goals set for the town from the input of the entire community.
        </p>
        <p>
The issues before us continue to <b>be balancing fiscal responsibility with providing the highest desert-living experience in Arizona, using sound judgment.</b> The “Fountain Hills Experience” must be maintained and improved upon, leveraging our assets without creating any shortfalls or losing our identity. 
        </p>
        <p>
The <b>foundation of any thriving community should include the arts, education, shopping, and recreation.</b> If we want to attract families, seniors, businesses, and tourism to the area, we must work to enhance and expand these foundation categories. 
        </p>
        <p>
I look forward to a positive campaign, reconnecting with our residents and businesses, and tackling the challenges before us.  I would be honored to receive your support and Vote!
        </p>
