Minecraft Bukkit plugin which integrates Minecraft to the Discord and vice versa.

Forked from [MineDisco/Minecraft-Discord-Bot-Bukkit](https://github.com/MineDisco/Minecraft-Discord-Bot-Bukkit)

## Features

* Messages from Minecraft chat can be delivered to the selected Discord channel
* Messages from selected Discord channel can be delivered to the Minecraft Chat
* Different types of messages (advancements, death messages, etc.) can be toggled to display by using commands or by
  editing the config file
* Minecraft users can be authenticated using Discord
* Existing users vote if new user should be let in to the server on the Discord

### Minecraft announcements that can be broadcast to Discord:

* Death notices
* Advancement messages
* Join/quit messages (with a count of the current players online)
* Server "say" messages from the server console

## Requirements

* Minecraft server which supports Bukkit plugins
* Be an owner of a Discord server

## Setup

1. Download latest plugin .jar from the releases and place it to the plugin folder of your server
2. When you start server first time with the plugin it generates default config file (explained below)
3. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/
4. Create new application
5. Create new bot for the application (Bot -> Add bot)
6. Copy bot token to the config.yml
7. Restart Minecraft Server
8. Invite it to your server:
    - Click "OAuth"
    - Select "bot"
    - Select bot permissions (at least "Administrator")
    - Copy URL and go to it
    - Select server where you want the bot to join and authorize it (If you do not see server in the list, you might not
      be an owner of that server)
9. Fill out the rest of the config.yml
10. Reload the plugin ('/reload confirm' in minecraft)
